SORTED TEXT
    A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
    Against the which, a moiety competent
    Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
    A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
    A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
    A little month, or ere those shoes were old
    Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
    A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
    And I with them the third night kept the watch;
    And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
    And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
    And carriage of the article design'd,
    And even the like precurse of fierce events,
    And foreign mart for implements of war;
    And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
    And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
    And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
    And our vain blows malicious mockery.
    And prologue to the omen coming on,
    And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
    And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
    And then it started like a guilty thing
    And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
    And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
    And vanish'd from our sight.
    And we beseech you, bend you to remain
    And we did think it writ down in our duty
    And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
    And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
    And with no less nobility of love
    An understanding simple and unschool'd:
    Appears before them, and with solemn march
    Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
    As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
    As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
    As harbingers preceding still the fates
    [Aside] A little more than kin, and less than kind.
    As if increase of appetite had grown
    As it doth well appear unto our state--
    As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
    As of a father: for let the world take note,
    As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
    At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
    A truant disposition, good my lord.
    Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
    Ay, madam, it is common.
BERNARDO

BERNARDO
    Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
    Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
    Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
    But I have that within which passeth show;
    But answer made it none: yet once methought
    But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
    But even then the morning cock crew loud,
    But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
    But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
    But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
    But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
    But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
    But to recover of us, by strong hand
    But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
    But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
    But what is your affair in Elsinore?
    But where was this?
    But, you must know, your father lost a father;
    By laboursome petition, and at last
    By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
    By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
CORNELIUS VOLTIMAND
    Cock crows
    Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
    Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
    Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
    Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
    Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
    Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
    Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
    Did you not speak to it?
    Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
    Do I impart toward you. For your intent
    Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
    Do, if it will not stand.
    Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
    Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
    Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
    Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
    Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO
    Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET, POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords, and Attendants 
    Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
    Exeunt
    Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS
    Exeunt all but HAMLET
    Exit Ghost
    Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
    Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
    Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
    For God's love, let me hear.
    For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
    For food and diet, to some enterprise
    For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
    Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
    For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
    For they are actions that a man might play:
    For what we know must be and is as common
    For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
    From the first corse till he that died to-day,
    From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
    Giving to you no further personal power
    Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
    Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
    Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
